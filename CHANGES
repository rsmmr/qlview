  * Polish code infrastructure.

  * Implement printing.

    We support printing only for certain file types, currently: `.gif`,
    `.jpg`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.rtf`, `.txt`. For all other formats,
    open them in their corresponding applications first and print from
    there.

  * Remove unneccessary state.
