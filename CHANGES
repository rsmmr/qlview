  * Switch `qlview` over to a full macOS app.

    This stops building `qlview` as a command-line application and makes
    it a normal app instead. As an app, it now supports a new URL scheme
    `qlview:/path/to/file` that allows opening documents from the
    command-line simply via `open`. The advantage of that approach is that
    we no longer end up start up separate `qlview` instances for each
    document being opened.

    We also switch from distributing a ZIP file to a more standard DMG.

  * mutt: Convert HTML to UTF8 before viewing if it comes in a different charset.

  * Tweak GitHub workflow.

  * Implement printing.

    We support printing only for certain file types, currently: `.gif`,
    `.jpg`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.rtf`, `.txt`. For all other formats,
    open them in their corresponding applications first and print from
    there.

  * Extend CI setup to build releases.

  * Polish code infrastructure.

  * Remove unnecessary state.
